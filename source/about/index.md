## Projects

### EEG4ASD (Backend)

{% link https://github.com/xiaoxuan010/eeg4asd-backend %}

A backend service for the EEG4ASD project, built with Spring Boot and MySQL. It provides RESTful APIs for user management, file/data handling, and deep learning model integration. It uses JWT authentication, role-based access control, and a RabbitMQ message queue to connect the Java backend with Python services for EEG data analysis.

I implemented the entire backend, including primary architecture design, [API design](https://apidoc.astralbridge.space/), database schema design, and DevOps server maintenance.

Initial development: August 2024.

### Dry Helper (Frontend)

It includes a [3D interactive map](https://dry-helper.xiaoxuan010.top/#/map) to visualize atmospheric moisture and explore humidity patterns over time. Three.js powers real-time 3D rendering and smooth layer animations.

Initial development: March 2024.
